Lesson 10 Explorations

Use PyPy as the runtime interpreter for code developed by students during the curriculum.
1. See if pypy improves the performance of any code written this class.Set up timers to meaures performance between pypy and python3.

 	a. pypy vs python for generators from Lesson 2.
	b. pypy vs python for Factorial (recursion) in Lesson 03.





2. Using the profiler, see how a recursive algorithm performs compared to a non-recursive algorithm. Use factorial equation.

3. Compare the performance of the mailroom versions, ie MONGODB, REDIS, Neo4J, SQL, and normal class instances.

4. Use a profiler to compare the Asynch vs threaded performances in Lesson 09.
