Lesson 10 Explorations

Use PyPy as the runtime interpreter for code developed by students during the curriculum.
1. See if pypy improves the performance of any code written this class.Set up timers to meaures performance between pypy and python3.

When you run 'pypy_vs_python.py', there are four math functions taken from Lesson 01. In python 3, the results are:

Doubler took: 0.143240262
Fibonacci took: 0.13524103099999998
Prime took: 11.817834877000001
Factorial took: 2.916194421




Next Experiment, explore the use of a list verse the use of generators in python:



Explore the use of list verse generators in pypy:








2. Using the profiler, see how a recursive algorithm performs compared to a non-recursive algorithm. Use factorial equation.

3. Compare the performance of the mailroom versions, ie MONGODB, REDIS, Neo4J, SQL, and normal class instances.

4. Use a profiler to compare the Asynch vs threaded performances in Lesson 09.
